Introduction
============

Golf is a web application server. Golf forms the user interface for web 
services.

Project Goals
-------------

Golf was designed to be:

* a modular, generalized component architecture from the ground up
* an extremely rapid development framework due to a natural separation of 
  responsibilities among the development team
* capable of providing fully dynamic content without sacrificing accessibility 
  to screen readers, web spiders, etc., and without any duplication of work or
  extra coding involved
